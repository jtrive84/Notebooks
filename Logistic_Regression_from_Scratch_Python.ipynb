    "## Estimating Logistic Regression Coefficents From Scratch (Python version)   \n",

    "In this post, I'll demonstrate how to estimate the coefficents of a Logistic Regression model using the [Fisher Scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_algorithm) algorithm. We will then compare our estimates to those generated by scikit-learn's [linear_model.LogisticRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) class when exposed to the same dataset. Specifically, we'll focus on how parameters of a Logistic Regression model are calculated when fit to data with a dicotomous response. \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Generalized Linear Model, the response may have any distribution from the exponential family, and rather than assuming the mean is a linear function of the explnatory variables, we assume that a function of the mean, or the *link function*, is a linear function of the explnatory variables.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Logistic Regression is used for modeling data with a categorical response. Although it's possible to model multinomial data using Logistic Regression, in this post we'll limit our analysis to models having a dichotomous response, where the outcome can be classified as 'Yes/No', 'True/False', '1/0', 'Good/Bad', etc...\n",
    "       \n",
    "The Logistic Regression model is a Generalized Linear Model whose canonical link is the logit, or log-odds:\n",

    "This post shed some light on the estimation routines that can be utilized in determining Logistic Regression coefficients, and walked through the mathematical justification. In addition, we briefly explored scikit-learn's *linear_model* API, and demonstrated two distinct estimation approaches which arrived at the same set of coefficients. For those who are interested, scikit-learn exposes a huge amount of functionality with thorough, easy-to-follow documentation that's full of straightforward examples. Get started [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Until next time, happy coding!\n",
