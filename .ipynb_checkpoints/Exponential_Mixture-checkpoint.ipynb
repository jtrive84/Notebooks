    "## Obtaining Quantiles from Mixed Exponential Distributions via Inverse Transform Sampling\n",

    "The CDF of mixed exponential distribution follows the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(x) = 1 - w_{1}e^{-\\lambda_{1}x} - w_{2}e^{-\\lambda_{2}x} - \\cdots - w_{n}e^{-\\lambda_{n}x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\sum_{i}^{n}w_{i} = 1$, and $\\lambda_{i}$ is the inverse of the expected value for the $i^{th}$ component in the mixture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the Newton-Raphson technique to find roots for exponential mixture distributions with an arbitrary number of components, we need to arrange the CDF expression so as to have all terms on one side set to zero. Rearranging yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{1}e^{-\\lambda_{1}x} + w_{2}e^{-\\lambda_{2}x} + \\cdots + w_{n}e^{-\\lambda_{n}x} - (1 - F(x)) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson update expression can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{f(x)}{f^{\\prime}(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With successive iterations providing better approximations of the root until a sufficiently accurate value is obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the rearranged CDF expression will serve as $f(x)$. The $f^{\\prime}(x)$ component will be the derivative of the rearranged CDF, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{\\prime}(x) = -\\lambda_{1}w_{1}e^{-\\lambda_{1}x} -\\lambda_{2}w_{2}e^{-\\lambda_{2}x} - \\cdots -\\lambda_{n}w_{n}e^{-\\lambda_{n}x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're dealing with a mixture of exponentials, we can commence iteration at $x_{0} = 0$ for all cases, and don't need to be concerned with searching for a preferred initialization point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is an implementation of the Newton-Raphson algorithm in R. It takes as arguments a starting point (which defaults to 0), a function `f` and the function's derivative `f_prime`. `epsilon` and `maxiters` have defaults which do not need to be changed:\n",

    "Assume we're interested in obtaining quantiles for a mixed exponential distribution with the following weights and means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* weights = (.60, .30, .10)\n",
    "* means = (10, 50, 100)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "Where the parameter for each term is the inverse of its corresponding mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sanity check, let's evaluate $F(x)$ at a few points to determine the CDF, which will serve as a stand-in for the uniform random numbers we'll be evaluating when the algorithm is actually put to use. \n",
    "Let's find the associated CDF for 10, 25, 75 and 200. This is straightforward in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "mixtureCDF = function(x) {\n",
    "    return(1 - .60 * exp(-x/10) - .30 * exp(-x/50) - .10 * exp(-x/100))\n",

The goal is upon being passed a random number such as 0.6909097246 (corresponding to the mixture distribution evaluated at 25), the algorithm will return \n",

    "We need one additional piece of functionality to complete the simulation framework: A function that wraps our `newtonRaphson` implementation, and takes for arguments a vector of means and a vector of weights, and returns another function which can then be passed a uniform random number and ultimately returns the corresponding percentile. This logic is encapsulated in `invertCDF`:\n",

    "Finally, we demonstrate how to use `invertCDF` to find quantiles from our sample exponential mixture CDF, $F(x) = 1 - .60e^{-x/10} - .30e^{-x/50} - .10e^{-x/100}$. Let's assume our sample uniform random draws are 0.4431693676, 0.6909097246, 0.8854924461 and 0.9809717788, which correspond to distribution values 10, 25, 75 and 200. Put another way, if we pass 0.4431693676, 0.6909097246, 0.8854924461 and 0.9809717788 to our simulation framework, we'd expect the values 10, 25, 75 and 200 to be returned. This serves as verification that the framework is performing as expected:\n",
