    "R's `glm` function is used to fit generalized linear models, specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor and a description of the error distribution [1](#Footnotes:). This function conceals a good deal of the complexity behind a simple interface, making it easy to overlook the calculations that determine a model's coefficents. The goal of this post is to shed some light on the setup and execution of those calcuations. \n",

    "In a Generalized Linear Model, the response may have any distribution from the exponential family, and rather than assuming the mean is a linear function of the explnatory variables, we assume that a function of the mean, or the *link function*, is a linear function of the explnatory variables.\n",

Although it's possible to model multinomial data using Logistic Regression, in this post we'll limit our analysis to models having a dichotomous response, where the outcome can be classified as 'Yes/No', 'True/False', '1/0', 'Good/Bad', etc...\n",

In future posts, we'll explore alternative estimations routines, and dig deeper into the statistics generated by the `glm` function, which can be used in determining the significance and/or the goodness-of-fit of a given model. Until then, happy coding!\n",
